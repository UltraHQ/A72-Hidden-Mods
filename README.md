# A72-Hidden-Mods
A magisk module adding the mods from ShaDisNX255's [XDA-Thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/samsung-galaxy-a71-working-mods.4173295/) plus many extra mods systemlessly!<br/>
Thanks ShaDisNX255 for allowing me to use your features! Without you, this project would've never started.

## This is the experimental branch. Many things are not tested enough, may cause bootloops, may cause issues and probably wont even make it into the release.<br/>I recommend using this with the [BootloopSaver module](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Alt-Repo/HuskyDG_BootloopSaver)

[XDA Thread of A72 Hidden Mods](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/magisk-module-a72-hidden-mods.4258825/)

#### For more mods on CSC-Level also get: [A72-CSC-Mods](https://github.com/UltraHQ/A72-CSC-Mods)

### Installation:
1. Download the branch / repository as a .zip
2. Open the magisk app and go to modules
3. Click the "Install from storage" button and select the .zip you just downloaded 

> Note: It should only be used on the Galaxy A72 (SM-A725F) running the corresponding android security patch version as written in the releases. Trying on other devices is at your own risk.<br/>The changes are always reversable, by simply removing the module in magisk.

### Troubleshooting:
If camera app crashes (or other issues like error on 64MP mode) please clear camera app data.

### Known bugs:
- Night Mode in camera: Taking a photo with the ultra wide cam will give you an error, but the photo will still save. The main cam does not have this problem. This issue is only present in night mode and nowhere else.
- Please report, if you find any
